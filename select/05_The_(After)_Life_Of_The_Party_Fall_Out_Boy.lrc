[00:06.85] I'm a stitch away from making it
[00:13.09] And a scar away from falling apart, apart
[00:20.38] Blood cells pixelate and eyes dilate
[00:26.53] And the full moon pills got me out on the street at night
[00:55.03] 
[00:33.06] Cut it loose, watch you work the room
[00:39.70] Cut it loose, watch you work the room
[00:46.57] Cut it loose, watch you work the room
[00:53.38] Cut it loose, watch you work the room
[01:11.88] 
[01:07.21] Oh, put love on hold, young Hollywood
[01:14.07] Is on the other line
[01:20.91] Her nose runs ruby red, death's in a double bed
[01:27.35] Singing songs that could only catch the ear of the desperate
[01:57.35] 
[01:33.74] Cut it loose, watch you work the room
[01:40.65] Cut it loose, watch you work the room
[01:47.37] Cut it loose, watch you work the room
[01:54.17] Cut it loose
[02:00.17] 
[02:08.64] I'm a stitch away from making it
[02:14.57] And a scar away from falling apart, apart
[02:22.07] Blood cells pixelate and eyes dilate
[02:28.28] Kiss away young thrills and kills on the mouths of all my friends
[03:00.78] 
[02:34.73] Cut it loose, watch you work the room
[02:42.33] Loose, watch you work the room
[02:48.48] Cut it loose (watch you work the room)
[03:07.48] 
[03:09.46] (I'm a stitch away)
[03:11.42] (I'm a stitch away)
